# Zabbix
This repo contains a setup script to automate installing Zabbix 6.0 on Debian tested on Debian GNU/Linux 11.2 bullseye).

You just need to install the base system vith netinstall, selecting only the base utilities, then, from a shell:

```
$ wget raw.githubusercontent.com/ravem/Zabbix/main/setup.sh
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh 
```

Still working on it so far form complete.
Use at own risk :smirk:
